           Hello and Welcome to our website all about Sri Lankan turtles!<br>
          <p>Did you know that Sri Lanka is home to five of the seven types of sea turtles in the whole world?
          That's pretty cool, right? These turtles come to our island every year to lay their eggs on our sandy beaches.
          But unfortunately, turtles are in trouble because people are doing things like cutting down their homes,
          catching them, and making the ocean dirty. So, we made this website to teach you all about Sri Lankan turtles and how you can help protect them.<p>
          <br>Come join us and learn all about these awesome creatures!

          <h2>Meet the Five Species of Sea Turtles in Sri Lanka</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>Sri Lanka is home to five of the seven species of sea turtles in the world.</h3>
          Each species is unique and has its own special characteristics.
           The most common species found in Sri Lanka are:
           <ol>
             <li> The Green Turtle</li>
             <li> The Olive Ridley Turtle</li>
             <li> The Hawksbill Turtle</li>
             <li> The Leatherback Turtle</li>
             <li> The Loggerhead Turtle</li>
           </ol>
           <p>The Green Turtle is the largest of the species found in Sri Lanka and is easily recognizable by its green skin and large body size
           TheBentota-view-from-upper.jpg Olive Ridley Turtle is the smallest and is named after its olive-colored shell.
           The Hawksbill Turtle is known for its beautiful, colorful shell and is critically endangered.
           The Leatherback Turtle is the largest turtle in the world and can weigh over 900 kilograms.
           Finally, the Loggerhead Turtle is named after its large head and powerful jaws, which help it to eat hard-shelled prey.
          All of these turtles are important members of Sri Lanka's marine ecosystem and play a vital role in maintaining the health of our oceans.<p>

         <h2>Sri Lanka's Sea Turtles Under Threat</h2>
       </header>
       <p><h3>Sea turtles in Sri Lanka face a number of threats to their survival.</h3> <br>The most significant of these is habitat loss, which is caused by human activities such as coastal development and tourism.
       Pollution in the oceans, particularly from plastic and other debris, also poses a major risk to turtles, as they can mistake it for food or become entangled in it.
       Illegal hunting, egg harvesting, and accidental capture in fishing gear are additional threats.</p>

       <p>Climate change is another major concern, as it can affect turtle nesting habitats and the temperature of the sand where eggs are laid.
       <br>To protect these magnificent creatures, it is important to take action to address these threats and ensure the health of Sri Lanka's marine ecosystems.</p>

         <h2>Turtles Hatcheries</h2>
       </header>
       <p>Hatcheries are essential facilities that play a crucial role in protecting sea turtle eggs from natural and human dangers.
         They provide a safe environment for the eggs to hatch, increasing the chances of survival for young turtles and
        are particularly important in areas where sea turtle nesting sites are threatened by human activities, such as coastal development and tourism.
       </p>
       <p>In addition to protecting sea turtles, hatcheries also provide a unique opportunity for visitors to learn about sea turtle conservation.
       Visitors can observe the process of protecting and caring for sea turtle eggs and hatchlings.
       Educational programs offered by hatcheries can also help to raise awareness about the threats facing sea turtles and the importance of taking action to protect them.</p>
